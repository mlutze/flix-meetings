* Refactor away imports
    * object calls, constructors, and static calls with the IO effect or pure (use `unsafe X`)
    * Matt makes a list of files to do 
* Null and arrays should be supported during this week
* Structs
    * should it have a scheme? yes, but not a function like `Enum.tag` has
        * Scheme.instantiate should returns its free var substitution, the struct typing can then apply that substitution to the field type
* merge FastSetUnifcation
* Java classes as effects? good idea - roundable to IO
