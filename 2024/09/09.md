## Conclusions

1. Autocomplete
    1. Experimental features should not have autocomplete support.
    2. Redundant features (e/checked cast) should not have autocomplete support.
    3. Unsafe features should not have autocomplete support.
        - "`unsafe` is not unsafe"
    4. Completion for `Collection#{}` interferes with modules. We will not support it.
    5. `with` and `where` are too hard for the parser to support. We will not support them for now.
2. Optimization
    1. Goal is primarily running time reduction, (which is associated with memory)
    2. Code size is a non-goal
    3. Two separate phases: occurrence analyzer and inliner
    4. It is acceptable for nonterminating/crashing programs to terminate/not-crash as a result of optimization (or execute more effects, etc.)

## Considerations
1. Block comments
    1. 4-1 vote in favor of removing block comments


## Action items

- Jonathan: make ticket to explore `debug!` functions
- Jonathan: explore whether internal tail-recursive functions really turn into `goto`s
- Matt: resurrect n-ary enums but let someone else take over
- Magnus: look at Zulip
